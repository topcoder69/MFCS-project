# MFCS-project

**INTRODUCTION**

The project is based on finding a Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal’s Algorithm.
The data set on which the MST was to be found is a list of the most frequently visited
places inside the campus of the University of Hyderabad along with the distances (in
Kilometers) that connected one place to another.

**RESULTS**

The graph formed for the matrix, that includes edges for every edge set (u,v) present is as
follows:

**CONCLUSION**

The conclusion drawn from the extensive data that was collected from the website as
well as manually is that the minimum distance (or cost) is roughly equal to 10.75 ~ 11
Kilometers.
