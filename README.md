# MFCS-project

**INTRODUCTION**

The project is based on finding a Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm.
The data set on which the MST was to be found is a list of the most frequently visited
places inside the campus of the University of Hyderabad along with the distances (in
Kilometers) that connected one place to another.

**DATA**

We have arbitrarily taken 38 most frequently places in HCU campus and are listed
below:
0 Main Gate
